# Wifi Name v1.0
Rename wifi to the old convention on Parrot Home and Parrot Security temporarily.

Simple utility for ease of use. This only resets the wifi card name temporarily, after 
reboot you would need to run it again to rename them again for scripts.

Feel free to use this script or parts of it as you like, all I ask for is credit as the original author
somewhere in the comments.
